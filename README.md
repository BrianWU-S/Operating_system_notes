# Operating_system_notes
This repository is for the course notes and core idea of SJTU CS307: Operating Systems. I also borrowed some key ideas from ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ's "Operating System Concepts" , 10th Edition. You can view the knowledge summary in "os_summary.pdf" and the mindmap of entire course in "Mindmap.pdf". Hope this will be helpful for you.
